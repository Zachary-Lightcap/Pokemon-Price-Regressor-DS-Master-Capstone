# Pokemon-Price-Regressor-DS-Master-Capstone
Price Regressor to predict card prices for new Pokemon cards using a multimodal neural network approach. A multimodal neural network is one that takes in the output of multiple data types, and combines them into a single neural network. In this case, the data was split into structured data and image data. The structured data was filtered through an artifical neural network, and the image data was sent through a convolutional neural network. Then, the final layer was taken from each neural network, and sent through a new neural network that combined both of the data points. 

This was done as a Master's capstone for the Data Science program at Rochester Institute of Technology

Includes:
* Python Notebook of the creation, cleaning of the data, preprocessing, and feature engineering
* Python Notebook of the training, testing, and saving of the models and results
* Capstone Research Paper describing the model
* Capstone Presentation Slides
* The saved models
* Some saved results and images


Thank you to the PokemonTCG Github for the base dataset.
